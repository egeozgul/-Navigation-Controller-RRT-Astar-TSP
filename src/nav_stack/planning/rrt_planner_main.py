"""
RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) Path Planner.

This planner generates collision-free paths between waypoints while avoiding obstacles.

RRT Algorithm:
1. Start with a tree containing only the start position
2. Randomly sample points in the workspace
3. Find the nearest node in the tree to the sampled point
4. Extend the tree toward the sampled point (step_size distance)
5. If the extension is collision-free, add new node to tree
6. Repeat until goal is reached or max iterations

Designed to work with:
- TSP planner for waypoint ordering
- Potential fields for dynamic obstacle avoidance
